The development of more efficient methods for drug screening and monitoring viral activity remains a critical need. The main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>), due to its important role in the virus lifecycle, high conservation, and specificity, is considered an ideal biomarker for SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we have developed several chemiluminescence probes based on different substrates modified from covalent inhibitors targeted at M<sup>pro</sup>. Among these, the best probe, MPCL-2, exhibits a rapid response (&lt;20 min), an extremely low limit of detection (LoD; 0.11 nM), great selectivity, and chemical stability. After validating the probe's mechanism of action, MPCL-2 can also be used for real-time, in-situ imaging of enzymes in cells infected with the authentic virus and has the potential for real-time, in-situ M<sup>pro</sup> imaging <i>in vivo</i>. Compared to other methods reported to date, the probe demonstrates superior performance and broader applicability, such as in drug screening or virus activity monitoring. Further, the unique design strategy for the substrate can be adopted to develop sensitive probes for other pathogens.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Xia</LastName><ForeName>Suping</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of New Drug Screening, NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Drug Metabolism and Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Joint Laboratory for New Drug Screening, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, People's Republic of China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Liang</LastName><ForeName>En</ForeName><Initials>E</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of New Drug Screening, NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Drug Metabolism and Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Joint Laboratory for New Drug Screening, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, People's Republic of China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Xu</LastName><ForeName>Leisheng</ForeName><Initials>L</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of New Drug Screening, NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Drug Metabolism and Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Joint Laboratory for New Drug Screening, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, People's Republic of China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Tan</LastName><ForeName>Liyi</ForeName><Initials>L</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of New Drug Screening, NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Drug Metabolism and Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Joint Laboratory for New Drug Screening, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, People's Republic of China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Guo</LastName><ForeName>Xiaowen</ForeName><Initials>X</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Clinical Research Center, Integrated Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510315, People's Republic of China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Cheng</LastName><ForeName>Kui</ForeName><Initials>K</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-4136-2070</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of New Drug Screening, NMPA Key Laboratory for Research and Evaluation of Drug Metabolism and Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Joint Laboratory for New Drug Screening, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, People's Republic of China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>11</Month><Day>22</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Anal Chem</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>0370536</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0003-2700</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>11</Month><Day>22</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>23</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>11</Month><Day>22</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>23</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>11</Month><Day>22</Day><Hour>3</Hour><Minute>15</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39574217</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1021/acs.analchem.4c04774</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle></PubmedArticleSet>
