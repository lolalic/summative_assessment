Long COVID has been compared to other post viral syndromes, including myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), where a reduction in day 2 cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) performance of a two-day CPET protocol is suggested to be a result of PEM. We investigated cardiopulmonary and perceptual responses to a two-day CPET protocol in Long COVID patients.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">15 Long COVID patients [n=7 females; mean (SD) age: 53(11) yr; BMI = 32.2(8.5) kg/m<sup>2</sup>] performed a pulmonary function test and two ramp-incremental CPETs separated by 24&#x202f;hr. CPET variables included gas exchange threshold (GET), peak oxygen uptake (V&#x307;O<sub>2peak</sub>) and peak work rate (WR<sub>peak</sub>). Ratings of perceived dyspnoea and leg effort were recorded at peak exercise using the modified 0-10 Borg Scale. PEM (past six months) was assessed using the modified DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (mDSQ). One-sample t-tests were used to test significance of mean difference between days (p&lt;0.05).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">mDSQ revealed PEM in 80&#x2009;% of patients. Lung function was normal. Responses to day 1 CPET were consistent with the presence of aerobic deconditioning in 40&#x2009;% of patients (V&#x307;O<sub>2peak</sub> &lt;80&#x2009;% predicted, in the absence of evidence of cardiovascular and pulmonary limitations). There were no differences between day-1 and day-2 CPET responses (all p&gt;0.05).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">PEM symptoms in Long COVID patients, in the absence of differences in two-day CPET responses separated by 24&#x2009;hours, suggests that PEM is not due to impaired recovery of exercise capacity between days.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Authors.
